A disassembly of the Simon Wai prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_ for the Sega Genesis, based on the 2007 disassembly by Esrael L.G. Neto. It is mostly identical to the original binary, barring differences with how the assembler compresses the sound driver, though this should not result in any differences with how the game behaves. It is dated around late-July/early-August 1992. The Simon Wai prototype is believed to have been first leaked in September 1992, before being distributed in BBS (bulletin board systems) numbers and was then bootlegged and sold in various Asian, Eastern European, and South American markets.

The actual origins of the original binary is disputed. Yuji Naka claims it was from a demonstration cart that was stolen from a New York toy fair in 1992, however magazines at the time attributed it to a specific British magazine; based on evidence at the time, however, it was likely a magazine leak, as the fifth issue of _Mean Machines Sega_ has a section where Rich Leadbetter discusses Sega of Japan's recent strict preview policies for European magazines, implemented after _Sonic 2_ pirates began cropping up, although they could also be referring to the CENSOR leak. Screenshots from this build were also found in issue 16 of Brazillian magainze _Supergame_

Whatever the case, the ROM Simon Wai found was a Hong Kong bootleg that was dumped using a Super Magic Drive onto a Chinese Geocities site. While it was originally believed the ROM was modified to disable the Sega screen, the later release of the August 21st build would confirm this was intentionally done by Sega Technical Institute, likely so that they could quickly test the game without needing to wait for the screen to finish (it was unskippable at this point).
