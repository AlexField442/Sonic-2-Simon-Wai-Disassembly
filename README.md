A disassembly of the Simon Wai prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_ for the Sega Genesis, based on the 2007 disassembly by Esrael L.G. Neto; it's not bit-perfect (some stuff such as the sound driver and checksum simply can't be made bit-perfect right now), but it's pretty damn close, and there shouldn't be any noticable differences in terms of gameplay. Wiki will eventually be made.
