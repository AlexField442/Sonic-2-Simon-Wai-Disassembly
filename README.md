A disassembly of the Simon Wai prototype of _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_ for the Sega Genesis, based on the 2007 disassembly by Esrael L.G. Neto; it's not bit-perfect (some music isn't compiling correctly, as is some later parts of the sound driver), but it's pretty damn close, and there shouldn't be any noticable differences in terms of functionality. Wiki will eventually be made.
